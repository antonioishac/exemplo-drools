Drools Terminilogy:
-Rules
	The heart of the Rules Engine where you specify conditions (if 'a' then 'b').
	
- Facts
	Facts are the data on whitch the rules will act upon. From Java prespective,
	Facts are the POJO (Plain Old Java Object).
	
- Session
	A Knowledge Session in Drools is the core component to fire the rules.
	It is the knowledge session that holds all the rules ans other resources.
	A knowledge Session is created from the knowledgeBase.
	
	For the roles engine to work, Facts are inserted into the session and whem ac
	condition is met, the subsequent rule gets fired. A session is of two types:
		. Stateless Knowledge Session
		. Stateful Knowledge Session
